All users add their own tasks & delete them whenever needed. The app has several bugs I need to fix. Its hosted on an Ubuntu AWS EC2  instance",

It shows the likelihood of giving birth before or after a womans due date. Its not intended for medical advice but simply to show how medical survey data in CSV format can be displayed. Also the CSV data is far outdated & was taken from hospitals in the USA ages ago",

Our task was to create a fullstack app where users can post notes anonymously with custom text, comment on them aswell as update & delete them in addition to being able to add GIFs from a Giphy API, using just a JSON file to store data on the Node/Express backend. It was interesting to see how databases could be as simple as a JSON file. I added a basic login & register feature as an extra & right now im improving the mobile responsiveness of the images. We also used Jest as a testing suite with a coverage of around 40%. Its hosted on an Ubuntu AWS EC2  instance",

Our challenge was to create a fullstack app using Docker that offers full CRUD operations & can keep track of a users habits. Another required feature was to add a secure login system & password hashing. This was succesfully done using jwt, node bcrypt & local storage. There are 2 possibilities we've explored to deploy it option1 ) Deploy html code on Netlify & run our docker server container on Heroku. Option 2) Change some docker compose commands to copy client,server & db into 1 container & serve it using express. Both seem to work? The habits are gym/fitness related. For e.g. However many times a week to go walking? How many ab crunches per day?",
